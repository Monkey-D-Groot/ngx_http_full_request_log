We developed this module in order to provide more insight into the specific 
nature and content of requests you're receiving (or proxying to backend applications).

It can be globally enabled/disabled at the server level and additionally toggled 
at any deeper granularity to log to a specific file for a given location/etc.

NOTE:
tested w/ nginx 0.7.67 on CentOS 64

FOR TESTING:
./configure --prefix=/bitly/local --with-http_stub_status_module --with-pcre=/bitly/src/pcre-7.8 --with-openssl=/bitly/src/openssl-0.9.8j --with-http_ssl_module --add-module=/bitly/src/github/ngx_http_full_request_log --with-debug
