In order to provide more insight into the specific nature and content of requests 
you may be receiving (or proxying to backend applications) we developed this 
module to fully log a request.

It can be globally enabled/disabled at the server level and additionally toggled 
at any deeper granularity to log to a specific file for a given location/etc.

NOTE:
tested w/ nginx 0.7.67 on CentOS 64
