We developed this module in order to provide more insight into the specific 
nature and content of requests you're receiving (or proxying to backend applications).

It can be globally enabled/disabled at the server level and additionally toggled 
at any deeper granularity to log to a specific file for a given location/etc.

NOTE:
tested w/ nginx 0.7.67 on CentOS 64
